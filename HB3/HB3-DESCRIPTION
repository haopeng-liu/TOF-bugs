This bug happens during the HMaster startup in HBase. 
After assigning the ROOT region to a live region server, HMaster suspends itself and waits for the assignment complete.

AssignmentManager.java (Line 245)
boolean processRegionInTransitionAndBlockUntilAssigned(final HRegionInfo hri) {
  ...
  this.regionsInTransition.wait();
  ...
}

On the other side, after opening the ROOT region, the region server sends a message to notify HMaster. In the message handler, HMaster checks the condition and send the notify to its main thread.

AssignmentManager.java (Line 730)
void regionOnline(...) {
  ...
  this.regionsInTransition.notifyAll();
  ...
}

If such message/notification is lost due to network issue or the region server is crashed, the main thread of HMaster will hang and cannot start up as usual.

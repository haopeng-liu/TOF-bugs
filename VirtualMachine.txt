1. Access the virtual machine with the following ssh command (password: !QAZ2wsx):
# ssh -p2345 fcatch@toadette.cs.uchicago.edu

In the home directory, each bug has a separate folder including source code, data and scripts to trigger.

2. You can also download the VM image: http://toadette.cs.uchicago.edu:5678/fcatch.vdi
Then create a virtual machine in VirtualBox with the image.
Log into the virtual machine with user name "fcatch" and password "fcatch"

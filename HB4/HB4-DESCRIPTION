This bug happens during the HMaster startup in HBase. 
After assigning the ROOT region to a live region server, HMaster suspends itself in a while-loop to check whether the ROOT region is still in RIT(region in transaction).

AssignmentManager.java (Line 245)
boolean processRegionInTransitionAndBlockUntilAssigned(final HRegionInfo hri) {
  ...
  this.regionsInTransition.wait();
  while (!this.master.isStopped() &&
    this.regionsInTransition.containsKey(hri.getEncodedName())) {
    ...
  }
  ...
}

On the other side, after opening the ROOT region, the region server sends a message to notify HMaster. In the message handler, HMaster checks the condition and send the notify to its main thread.

AssignmentManager.java (Line 730)
void regionOnline(...) {
  ...
  this.regionsInTransition.remove(regionInfo.getEncodedName());
  ...
}

If such message/notification is lost due to network issue or the region server is crashed, the main thread of HMaster will hang in the while-loop and cannot start up as usual.
